    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm <b>Ameen</b>, a passionate Software Engineer working at an MNC with 4 years of experience in IT.  
        I started my journey as a System Administrator, and currently, I am excelling in software development.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is my first web page, deployed as part of my Udemy course "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer", covering  
        <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps</b>.  
        My keen interest in web development led me to enroll in this course, and now, here I am, deploying my first website!
    </p>

    <p>
        Education:  
        I'm a BSc. Computer Science graduate from Calicut University.  
        Previously, I worked on a NEWS website project where people could upload local news, but due to unforeseen reasons,  
        the project was discontinued.
    </p>

    <p>
        Personal Life:  
        I am from Edappatta, Malappuram, Kerala, currently working remotely (WFH), which allows me to spend quality  
        time with my parents and siblings.  
        - Father: Works in the Gulf  
        - Mother: Homemaker  
        - Sister: Business Administration graduate (BBA)
